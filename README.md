## What is this?

I was told to create a minisite to celebrate the lunar sub-new year, which you get blessings from the new media of our school.

So I thought it would be nice to explore SVG SMIL Animation. Here is what I got eventually.

## Setbacks

Testing on Android TBS (the default WebView used in mega app, WeChat) and Mobile Safari is a pain in the ass,

for they are super bitchy about fromats of SVG attributes.

## Drawbacks

I was a bit of rushing time, but the page needs to fill and spread the entire viewport.

But there are so many of them! I spent most of the time on making transitions to wired screen ratios and browsers.

So I did what I had to do.

__Dynamic font size! Default serif font! (Well it looks great in Chinese, so...) Experimental CSS features! ID selector all over the place! Quirky usage of flex!__

~~Yay, why not? Once you have touched the chaotic coding style when creating amateur web pages, you can never go back.~~

## Glossary

The texts used in the modal panel are selected from paragraphs of an essay full of gibberish.

I found it the perfect painkiller whenever I feel headache for generating Chinese Lorem Ipsum.

Don't panic, you can replace them with you own texts in the JavaScript part.
