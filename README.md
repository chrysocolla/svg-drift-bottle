Simple drift bottle demo using SVG SMIL Animation

## What is this?

I was told to create a minisite to celebrate the lunar sub-new year, which you get blessings from the new media of our school.

So I thought it would be nice to explore SVG SMIL Animation. Here is what I got eventually.

## Setbacks

Testing on Android TBS (the default WebView used in mega app, WeChat) and Mobile Safari is a pain in the ass,

for they are super bitchy about fromats of SVG attributes.

## Drawbacks

I was a bit of rushing time, but the page needs to fill and spread the entire viewport.

But there are so many of them! So I did what I have to do.

__Dynamic font size! ID selector all over the place! Quirky flex column-reverse!__

~~Yay, why not? Once you touched the evil part of web when creating amateur pages, you can never got back.~~

## Glossary

The words used in the modal panel are selected from paragraphs of an essay full of gibberish.

I found it the perfect painkiller whenever I feel headache for generating Chinese Lorem Ipsum.

Don't panic, you can replace them with you own texts in the JavaScript part.
